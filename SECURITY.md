## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this project, please report it **privately**.

- 📧 **Email:** tim@xervion.nl  
- 📝 **Subject line:** Must start with `SECURITY`  
- 🚫 **Do not open public issues** for security concerns — this allows us time to fix the issue before public disclosure.
